# Moods on Display

This is a neat application which uses the chosen AI model based on MobileNet in-app. Everything within this app is used locally on the device downloaded.

Moods on Display sorts users images into emotionally categorised albums with an attempt to allow those who take to many photos an easier time to reflect on the photos sorted for them effortlessly.
